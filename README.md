# Xous Kernel

This contains the core kernel for Xous.  It requires a stage 1 loader in
order to start up, as it assumes the system is already running in
Supervisor mode.

## Building

To build the kernel, you will need a riscv32 target for Rust.  Possible
targets include `riscv32i-unknown-none-elf`, `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`,
or `riscv32imac-unknown-xous-elf`.

1. Decide what target you want.  For simple, embedded systems this could
   be `riscv32i-unknown-none-elf`, and for more complex systems with
   compressed instructions you could use `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`.
2. Get Rust.  Go to https://rustup.rs/ and follow its instructions.
3. Install the proper toolchain: `rustup target add ${target_arch}`
4. Build the kernel: `cargo build --release --target ${target_arch}`

## Using

To use the kernel, you must package it up into an arguments binary with
`xous-tools`.

## Testing

_TBD_
